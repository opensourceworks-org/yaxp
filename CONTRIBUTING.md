# Contributing

Same old, same old. Fork, clone, branch, commit, push, pull request. You know the drill.

Except for the python project, which uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and it changes a few things.

Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](crates/pyaxp/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the crate's root directory for more information.
